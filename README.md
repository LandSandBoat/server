# AirSkyBoat

Welcome to AirSkyBoat, an open source server emulator for FFXI based off of the level 75 era. Our repository is a fork off of the parent project LandSandBoat, which you can find at https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server.

Our main place that we discuss changes and issues is on our Discord which can be found at https://discord.gg/SM2J2z8Cz6

At AirSkyBoat, we are focused on giving credit where its due when pulling in Open Source material from other repositories. If you find that we have not properly given credit for accepted code, please reach out to us on our Discord so that we can correct it.

As AirSkyBoat is a derivative of LandSandBoat, please use all of their guides for how to setup a server. They have a great and consistently updated wiki for how to work with their systems.
