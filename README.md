Pull Requests should **not** target the info or topaz branch. I recommend basing your work on the community maintained "stable branch".


## Mini-FAQ
Q: Will you review my PR Teo? Does this mean Teo is developer again? Or Lead developer?

A: No, No, and oh hell no. The most I will do for the freedom branch is check the reviews others have left. If a merged PR broke something, someone will have to PR a fix or PR a revert. Github makes this easy. https://github.blog/2014-06-24-introducing-the-revert-button/

Q: what standards do reviewers hold PRs to?

A: All code styling requirements from Topaz-Next are still valid, but if reviewers miss things its "Not Teo's problem". 

Q: I need help! Is there anywhere I can ask questions besides the github issues?

A: https://discord.gg/6EWFPxkZja

Q: Gimme a staff role! I can help!

A: You can help on 99% of things without any special roles. Things aren't gated much. But if I see you regularly being helpful, you will likely get a role to facilitate additional helping.
