-----------------------------------
-- Trust: Tenzen II
-- Todo: Constantly adjusts his distance for optimal ranged damage (always shot from sweet spot).
-- BIG Todo: make his TP gains per shot match retail at all levels
-- Tenzen II Gets 252 TP per hit at lv 90+ ONLY, see https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/BGWiki:Trusts#Tenzen_II
-- While the changes in TP gain do happen at the levels a SAM would get a storeTP trait adjustment,
-- no combination of STP and wDelay aligns with the TP change in a way that makes all the different amounts
-- make any kind of sense. Some sort of override is seeded to SET his exact TP gain based on a level check.
-- There's just no other way to be retail accurate while having his attack delay match retail.
-- This also means retail unfairly nerfs his TP gains prior to level 90,
-- as other ranged attackers have the amount at level one he doesn't until level 90.
-- I can't help but wonder if he is simply bugged on retail and nobody ever realized it.
