-----------------------------------
-- These values are the codes that represent any statistic possible on an entity.
-- These are NOT the actual status effects such as weakness or silence,
-- but rather arbitrary codes chosen to represent different modifiers to the effected characters and mobs.
--
-- Even if the particular mod is not completely (or at all) implemented yet, you can still script the effects using these codes.
--
-- Example: target:getMod(xi.mod.STR) will get the sum of STR bonuses/penalties from gear, food, STR Etude, Absorb-STR, and any other STR-related buff/debuff.
-- Note that the above will ignore base statistics, and that getStat() should be used for stats, Attack, and Defense, while getACC(), getRACC(), and getEVA() also exist.
